Highly lauded by his peers as one of the great young minds that will revolutionize the field, he is blessed with a beautiful fiancée and is on the cusp of a big promotion in the hospital he works at. But all of that is about to change with a grave dilemma that Kenzou faces one night—whether to save the life of a small boy or that of the town's mayor. Despite being pressured by his superiors to perform surgery on the mayor, his morals force him to perform the surgery on the other critical patient, saving his life and forfeiting the mayor's. A doctor is taught to believe that all life is equal; however, when a series of murders occur in the surgeon's vicinity, all of the evidence pointing to the boy he saved, Kenzou's beliefs are shaken. Along his journey to unravel the true identity of his little patient, Kenzou discovers that the fate of the world may be intertwined with the mysterious child.","status":"finished","genres":["Drama","Horror","Mystery","Police","Psychological","Seinen","Thriller"],"startDate":"2004-04-07","endDate":"2005-09-28","episodeCount":74,"episodeLength":24,"source":"manga","image":{"extension":".jpg","width":344,"height":500,"averageColor":{"hue":0.6573813982521849,"saturation":0.03877995642701525,"lightness":0.42023346303501946},"lastModified":1522862539},"firstChannel":"日本テレビ","rating":{"overall":8.688090853284223,"story":8.5,"visuals":7.428571428571429,"soundtrack":7.416666666666667,"count":{"overall":181,"story":7,"visuals":7,"soundtrack":6}},"popularity":{"watching":49,"completed":179,"planned":386,"hold":73,"dropped":16},"trailers":[{"service":"Youtube","serviceId":"9aS-EgdAq6U"}],"episodes":["2KlqThFWg5z","hF_qohKWRtz","2F_3ohFWg2z","hK_3ThFWRTz","2FlqThFZRAz","hF_3ohKZgJz","hK_3ThFZRbz","hKl3o2KWgaz","hK_3ThKZRBz","hK_qThFWRLz","hFlqT2FZREz","2K_3ThFZgyz","hKl3ohKZRUz","hF_3T2FWgwz","2K_qo2KWRlz","2F_3T2KZgXz","hF_qohFWR9z","hKlqT2FZRCz","hF_3ohFZR3z","2Kl3ThFWgez","2FlqT2KZRgm","2K_qThKWRzm","hF_qThFZgmm","2K_qThKZgZm","hKlqT2KZRMm","2Kl3ohFZR7m","2FlqohKWRVm","hKlqohKWgIm","hKl3T2KWRNm","2K_3o2FZRvm","2F_3ThFZgOm","hF_3T2KWgFm","hK_3T2FZRcm","hK_3T2KWRpm","hK_qo2KWghm","hK_3ThKWgom","hKlqT2FWg0m","2K_3ThKZR1m","2F_qohKZgxm","2F_3ohKZR-m","2F_3o2FWRfm","hK_qohFWRYm","hFl3ohFWRPm","hF_3ThFWgsm","hK_qohFWg8m","2F_qo2KZRQm","hK_qo2FZg_m","hF_qohKWgum","hK_3T2KWRrm","hK_qThFZRjm","2Fl3ohKWRqm","hK_qThKWg6m","hFl3ThKWgRm","hKl3ThKZgkm","2Klqo2KWRim","2K_qThKWRWm","hF_3ThFZgGm","2Fl3T2FWgnm","2K_3ohKZR4m","hK_3T2FZRSm","2F_3T2FZRHm","TF_3ohFWR","TK_qT2KWgz","TFl3o2FWgm","oK_3ohKWgZ","oF_qT2KZRM","TKlqohFZR7","oK_qo2FWgV","oF_3o2KZRI","TFlqo2KZgN","TK_qohFWRv","TKl3ThFZRO","oKlqo2KZRF","oKl3ohFWgc","TKlqohKZgp"],"mappings":[{"service":"shoboi/anime","serviceId":"355"},{"service":"anilist/anime","serviceId":"19"},{"service":"myanimelist/anime","serviceId":"19"},{"service":"thetvdb/anime","serviceId":"74599"},{"service":"anidb/anime","serviceId":"1539"},{"service":"trakt/anime","serviceId":"30847"},{"service":"kitsu/anime","serviceId":"10"}],"posts":null,"likes":null,"created":"","createdBy":"","edited":"2018-03-22T21:02:02Z","editedBy":"NJ3kffzwl","isDraft":false,"studios":["bjA89n8zRR"],"producers":["aC089nUzR-","bC0Ur7Uzgpm","-C08rn8kR5"],"licensors":["xC0897UkgQ"],"links":null}
